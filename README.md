Debug in progress, no release for now.....

Search &amp; play several French Television Replay streams (Pluzz, Arte, Canal+) - Python / CLI

This application will list & play streams available on several French TV channels :
 * Pluzz
 * Arte
 * Canal+

*WARNING:*
 * All streams are **copyrighted by France Televisions, ARTE and Canal+**. 
 * You are **NOT** free to *share*, *sell* or *modify* those videos !

*The reasons why i wrote this app'*

This command-line software was written in Python as an alternative solution to avoid use of Flash Player which is not optimized for Linux-based OS. This may also help you if like me your internet connexion bandwith is too small to watch HD live streams.

This is my first app with Python, so please be clement... 

It was originally based on *solsticedhiver/arteVIDEOS* project, i made some tests & updates on it to make it work again then i made some adaptations for other channels.
